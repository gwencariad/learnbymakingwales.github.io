# Shwmae!
### 28 October 2022

Weâ€™re the Learn by making team.

Dysgu trwy greu (duss-gi true-ih grey), Learn by making, is an experimental digital lab, set up to explore how people learn by making things. [Sponsored by the Centre for Digital Public Services](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/) (CDPS), this initiative forms part of [Campws Digidol](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/our-work/digital-training/). Dysgu trwy greu will run alongside digital training courses, communities of practice and informal meet ups where teams from across Wales can share their skills and expertise.
