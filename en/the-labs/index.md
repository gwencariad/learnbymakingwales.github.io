The learn by making digital lab will consist of a set of activities split across 4 themes.

Each lab will be unique to the team taking part and the activities will be chosen to give them a specific, practical and helpful experience making digital products and services. The aim is that all participants will be able to use what they learn in the labs in their own role afterwards.

The activities will be practical, immersive sessions that will help people taking part learn digital skills and make things - in the open, for real.

We have 4 themes which we see as the most important parts of learning by making.

The themes are:

* **Introducing agile service design** - Introducing techniques with practical activities and fast-paced design challenges 

* **How to research the problem space** - Experience qualitative and quantative research techniques and learn how to identify and prioritise problems to solve

* **How to learn by making** - Design and build protoypes to test your assumptions and learn about real users

* **How to build momentum** - Explore how sharing in the open builds momentum
