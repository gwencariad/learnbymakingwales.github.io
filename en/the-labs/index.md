The learn by making digital lab will consist of a set of activites split across 4 themes.

Each lab will be unique to the team taking part and the activities will be chosen to give them specific, practical, helpful experience making digital products and service. We hope all participants will be able apply what they learn to their work once the labs have finished.

The activities will be practical, immersive sessions that help participants learn digital skills and make things - in the open, for real.

The themes are what we see as the 4 key components of learning by making.

The themes are:

* Hello and design challenges
* Researching the problem space
* Making
* Test, learn and share
