The learn by making digital lab will consist of a set of activities split across 4 themes.

Each lab will be unique to the team taking part and the activities will be chosen to give them a specific, practical and helpful experience making digital products and services. The aim is thatall participants will be able to use what they learn in the labs in their own role afterwards.

The activities will be practical, immersive sessions that will help people taking part learn digital skills and make things - in the open, for real.

We have 4 themes which we see as the most important parts of learning by making.

The themes are:

* hello and design challenges
* researching the problem space
* making
* test, learn and share
